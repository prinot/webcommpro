                <p>Before getting into the details of Virtual Instructor-Led Training, it may be best to explain what Virtual Instructor-Led Training means.</p>
                <p>Simply, it is a training method in which a virtual environment is used by a trainer/coach to show, explain and  help others learn.</p>
                <p>Virtual Training, or also known as Virtual Instructor-Led Training (VILT) takes the fundamentals of face-to-face (F2F) classroom training and repeats the experience through a virtual platform such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUUbA53ouSo" target="_blank">Microsoft Teams</a> or <a href="https://info.thevirtualtrainingteam.co.uk/blog/zooms-update-5.2-loads-of-awesome-new-features-for-meetings" target="_blank">Zoom.</a></p>
                <p>Good virtual workshops are super-interactive and engaging. There are multiple opportunities for participants to join in with discussions, share their experiences, practice skills and conversations and ask questions.</p>
                <p>Most commonly, virtual workshops are bite-size, running from 60 to 180 minutes and are sometimes combined with other methods of training, F2F or other online elements, such as e-learning or webinars, to create a blended learning programme.</p>

                    <li>Virtual workshops are interactive. Everyone joins in on discussions, shares experience, practises conversations and asks questions. They may choose to use a webcam. Quality VILT workshops should be a conversation and not a presentation.</li>

                </div>
                <p>Transitioning to an online space has been shown to give workplace learning the next step forwards and achieves greater accessibility. Certainly, in recent months, this has been proven to be the case many times over, with the world shifting to a more virtual setting.</p>
                <p>But what is virtual learning and why is it so popular?</p>
                <p>Simply put, Virtual Training is a shared learning experience that is produced  through computers and the internet. Training occurs exactly the same as it would in a co-located, physical environment only, the coach and learners are separated from each other. </p>
                <p>It is increasingly popular due to its ease of accessibility, its cost-effective nature and the flexibility it affords its learners and adopting organization.</p>

                <p>The approach offers a wide range of benefits, that physical classroom training cannot match, such as:-</p>

               

                <img src="images/virtual-instructor-led-training-benefits.jpg" alt="Virtual Instructor-Led Training benefits" title="Virtual Instructor-led training benefits" class="infographic-width">
                <ol class="ol-list1">
                    <li><strong><h3>Enhanced flexibility.</h3></strong> The ability to join training sessions easily and quickly with no commute and no need to attend a physical venue is a great advantage. Running Virtual learning workshops allows learners to return to their daily duties with minimal disruption to their working day is another upside.</li>
                    

                    <li><strong><h3>Accessibility for all.</h3></strong> Training in virtual classrooms allows much greater accessibility for all employees, due to having no physical, centralised location where the training takes place. Anyone with access to a computer and internet connection, can take part in <a href="https://www.thevirtualtrainingteam.co.uk/virtual-workshops" target="_blank">virtual workshops</a>, no matter where they are located.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong><h3>More Inclusivity.</h3></strong> People learn in different ways. The virtual classroom fosters an enhanced capability to facilitate and meet the needs of many, by offering a myriad of ways in which to learn. Vocally, visually, by using colours or video in presentations, the only limit is time and the facilitator’s imagination. Also, those colleagues sited in remote locations get equal access to their development as do those at HQ.</li>
                    

                    <li><strong><h3>Cost Effective.</h3></strong> Once you remove the travel, venue costs, accommodation, and the productivity loss caused by time away from work, training can become much more budget-friendly when undertaken virtually. It renders many of the additional costs associated with providing organisational training obsolete. There is no need for trains, planes and automobiles when the training can take place at your own desk, nor lunches, coffees and we could go on….</li>

                </div>

                <p>Virtual Instructor-Led Training (VILT) and Instructor-Led Training (ILT) have some things in common. They are both training techniques used to achieve learning transfer with a cohort of participants. </p>
                <p>Where they differ is in their delivery mode. VILT takes place ‘live’ entirely online, using a platform, such as Microsoft Teams or Zoom, and allows participants to take part regardless of location, in an office, remotely or nowadays when working from home. </p>
                <p>ILT is traditionally conducted in a physical classroom, meeting room or conference space, often with participants who have travelled to a central location in order to attend.</p>
                <p>At VTT, we say that VILT offers a major uplift in benefits compared to ILT, such as being more cost effective, more accessible and genuinely inclusive for a wider selection of participants.</p>

                <p><strong>Use the following 5 tips to enhance the outcomes of your VILT learning sessions:-</strong> </p>

                <ol class="ol-list1">
                    <li><strong>Have participants turn on their webcams.</strong> Creating visual contact is important, allowing facilitators to better connect with their learners.</li>
                    <li><strong>Build rapport and trust through real conversation and information sharing.</strong> Getting to know participants is key for facilitators especially in a VILT setting. In order to develop this relationship, facilitators  need to allow more time for introductions at the beginning of a workshop. Also, being friendly, personable and authentic really adds to outcomes for participants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Get expert on the technology before running virtual deliveries on it.</strong> Trainers who are fully versed in their platforms are better equipped to deal with occasional technical hiccups and can prevent them from occurring altogether in some cases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encourage the minimisation of distractions. </strong>Urge participants to focus their concentration by choosing a dedicated space in which to log in, put other devices on silent and use techniques that create engagement and immersion in the learning from the get-go.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be engaging and interactive to uplift participant focus.</strong> Designing interesting and involving content will go a long way to keeping participants on task and enhancing the learning transfer.</li>
                </ol>

                </div>

                <ul class="ul-bulltlist">
                    <li><h3>Turn webcams on</h3></li>
                    <p>It is key to have your camera on as the trainer, but it is also important to give your participants the opportunity to see and interact with each other as well. Body language and facial expressions are an essential part of communication and when available through the virtual medium enhance the experience for all attending.</p>

                    <li><h3>One device per person</h3></li>
                    <p>Virtual Training works much better when it is attended by one participant per one device. When each participant joins via their own device the experience is enhanced as is learning transfer and engagement.</p>

                    <li><h3>Breaks in long sessions</h3></li>
                    <p>For longer sessions, it is worth scheduling in timely breaks, allowing participants to grab a drink or just stretch their legs for a moment. They then return refreshed and ready to continue.</p>

                    <li><h3>Audio is key</h3></li>
                    <p>Audio is integral to the success of a virtual workshop, as it is a main tool of communication. Encourage participants to manage their mute, if for example they are dealing with excessive background noise, or feedback.</p>

                    <li><h3>Foster inclusivity</h3></li>
                    <p>Make sure that whole group discussions are a part of your engagement during the workshop, some of the best conversations happen when a wider array of people are involved. Keep a log of participants' contributions and encourage equal and regular inputs.</p>

                    <li><h3>Keep an eye on the time</h3></li>
                    <p>We have noticed that everything seems to take longer in the virtual setting. Consider factoring in extra time for breakout groups, tasks or small group conversations.</p>

                    <li><h3>Polling and Voting</h3></li>
                    <p>Give your participants the opportunity to contribute to discussions or display their understanding with the poll function.</p>

                    <li><h3>Practice!</h3></li>
                    <p>This one always goes without saying, but practice is key. The more you practice, the smoother your delivery experience will be.</p>

                    <li><h3>Ask for Feedback</h3></li>
                    <p>It is important to ask for feedback on your sessions, especially when first starting out, which can help you to identify the areas of your workshop that are working well and those  needing improvement.</p>

                    <li><h3>Make eye contact</h3></li>
                    <p>Look directly into your camera. This gives your participants the feeling of true eye contact with you and can help to increase connectivity and communication. It’s weird at first, especially if your camera is off to one side of your screen- but you’ll get used to it!</p>
                    <li><h3>What do your participants see?</h3></li>
                    <p>When starting out, it can be worthwhile to test your set-up and practice your delivery with a second device prior to your actual live learning session. This allows you to see what your participants see, as their screen and set up can be different to your own. In order to facilitate a smooth experience, it can be helpful to know how their screen may be displayed.</p>

                    <li><h3>Keep a learner log</h3></li>
                    <p>For many virtual trainers, a learner log is a golden tool. It helps you to remember key pieces of information about participants, from how engaged they have been, to details about them that will help you to encourage their learning on an ongoing basis.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Choosing the right VILT platform software for your organisation is vitally important. It is key to the success of any Virtual Training programme and your learners' experience, so investing the right time and effort to ensure your chosen platform suits your organizational requirements is a must.</p>
                <p>The following are examples of the more widely used and available platforms we have experience of.</p>

                    <p>Zoom is an online audio and web conferencing platform. It can be used to make phone calls, or to participate in video conference meetings.</p>
                    <p>While there is a basic option that is free, in order to run Virtual Training workshops via the platform, there are a couple of upgrade options, such as Zoom Pro, Zoom Business or Zoom Enterprise. Each of these adds a substantial set of additional features to the solid basic plan, such as the ability to have a conference of more than 100 people at a time, or most importantly, extend a learning session beyond a standard 40 minutes.</p>
                    <p>It offers a host of tools on the platform like screen sharing, the ability to record, on screen annotations, breakout groups, chat, emojis and most recently in their <a href="https://info.thevirtualtrainingteam.co.uk/blog/zooms-update-5.2-loads-of-awesome-new-features-for-meetings" target="_blank">5.2 update</a>, the ability to present from your slides like a weather reporter.</p>

                    <p>It has grown in popularity rapidly in recent months and is a serious contender for Virtual Training due to its wide range of capabilities but also down to it being a reliable, high quality conference tool that is easy to use.</p>

                    <li>Entirely remotely accessible for all and can be offered worldwide. In fact, with some careful planning, most time zones can also be catered for.</li>

                <blockquote class="qouth-box qouth-hight-color">So that’s the short overview of what makes Virtual Training beneficial to you, but what about some tangible <a href="https://info.thevirtualtrainingteam.co.uk/blog/some-surprising-benefits-of-virtual-training-vilt" target="_blank">Virtual Training benefits</a> to taking whole training programmes and moving them online?</blockquote>


                <ul class="ul-bulltlist">
                <li><h3>Flexibility</h3></li>
                <p>Virtual Training can be accessed from anywhere where there is internet. This removes the need to coordinate time and travel for multiple participants at once, thus lowering cost, time and the resources needed to ensure a good experience for learners.</p>

                <p>Most <a href="https://info.thevirtualtrainingteam.co.uk/blog/what-is-a-virtual-training-program-a-walkthrough-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank">Virtual Training Programmes</a> disperse their learning material into bite-size chunks. The lack of travel and preparation time results in an ability to train more regularly yet for shorter periods of time. This creates a more effective learning environment because it allows more time in between workshops to digest information, models and approaches learned.</p>

                <li><h3>Accessibility</h3></li>
                <p>There has never been a more inclusive, accessible way to provide training in an organisation! Wherever your employees are based, remote, homeworker, hot-desking office attendee, nomad worker caravanning in Cairo, Virtual Training offers them all the equal opportunity to attend virtual workshops, learn new skills and up their game.</p>
                <p>We find this leads to a much more diverse virtual classroom. Participants who may have struggled to attend a traditional co-located workshop are now easily able to attend live workshops which include, interactive collaboration and discussions with other colleagues. This creates rich, varied conversation which invariably is massively effective, creating insight and deeper understanding of key issues.</p>

                <li><h3>Application</h3></li>
                <p><a href="https://www.thevirtualtrainingteam.co.uk/" target="_blank">Virtual Training</a> is easily integrated into the working day and does not require any travel. This means that participants can apply the skills learned during a virtual workshop immediately into their working environment.</p>
                <p>Virtual programs are often delivered through numerous bite-sized workshops which allows participants to practise a succinct number of the tools and techniques as they progress.</p>
                <p>This way of learning improves retention and provides an on-the-job application that improves outcomes for learners.</p>

                </div>
                <p>We know that simply lifting a slide-deck from a face-to-face (F2F) workshop and presenting it in a virtual one just doesn’t deliver the best results.</p>
                <p>So, where do you start when building a workshop specifically for virtual delivery?</p>
                <p>Well, virtual workshops are bitesize in nature, so choosing the correct content to make time work best for you is critical.</p>
                <p>Here are our steps for designing Virtual Instructor-Led Training.</p>

                <img src="images/common-challenges-of-virtual-instructor-led-training.jpg" alt="5 top tips - Common Challenges of Virtual Instructor-Led Training" title="Common Challenges of Virtual Instructor-Led Training" class="infographic-width">
                <span class="heading24">1.</span>
                <h3 class="heading24">Start with the end goal in mind</h3>
                <ul class="top-saven-list">
                    
                    <li>What do you want participants to think, feel, do or know as a result of this workshop? It’s an important question.</li>
                    <li>A common mistake that designers can make is opening up PowerPoint and thinking, “Right. Slide 1…” </li>
                    <li>How can you know what to include if you haven’t carefully considered the desired outcome of the workshop as a whole?</li>
                    <li>Starting with the result you are looking to achieve and then working back from there makes it much easier to edit and decide on content and process, so then everything is focused on achieving that result.</li>
                </ul>
                <span class="heading24">2.</span>
                <h3 class="heading24">Brainstorm Content Early</h3>
                  <ul class="top-saven-list">
                    
                    <li>What are your key messages that you want participants to take away from your session? What key skills, models or processes might you include?</li>
                    <li>If you are converting something that already exists F2F into a virtual workshop, then you will have some content to begin with.</li>
                    <li>Take the time to really consider what could be included over what already exists. Making the most of this step gives you the opportunity to refresh content too and make it successfully work for the virtual environment.</li>
                    <li>Even if you are designing from scratch, this step is still important. Get creative and think about what you know that could be useful to help achieve the result you’re aiming for. Don’t worry though, you won’t include it all, it just helps to create a smorgasbord of different ideas to choose from.</li>

                    <li>Come back to the purpose of your virtual workshop. If there is content or processes that don’t move your learners towards that outcome, then don’t use it.</li>
                    <li>Everything takes a little bit longer in the virtual environment compared to F2F, so be sure to consider how much time you have got. </li>
                    <li>Virtual workshops are often best delivered in bite-sized format - somewhere between 90 mins and 2 hours. It is often worth considering delivering two separate workshops that give you time to explore what you need to, without being rushed, rather than having everything crammed into a single one.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Ideally, you want variety in your approaches, but still with purpose. Consider best practice for each model and how it feeds back into your purpose.</li>

                    <li>What will go on your welcome slide? How will you grab the attention of the participants as they enter the session, to get them thinking and interacting with the tech immediately?</li>
